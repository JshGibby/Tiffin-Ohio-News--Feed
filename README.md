This is a news feeds aggregator. It will be filled with a lot of resources on public places, businesses, events, community news &amp; officials. 

It works by gathering data from public Facebook Pages and organizing them into different categorical newsfeeds. 

So anyone that wants to can stay up to date easily with what goes on locally around town. Making the community more connected. 

This is to use freely by Importing The OPML Feed Subscriptions file into a free Google Chrome extension called FeedBro.

Click on the subscriptions then the file go to Raw now right click and save the file to your computer and import the OPML into Feedbro.

[Note: overuse may lead to temporary blocking to the API of Facebook Pages due to accessing them too fast. In any case either log out of Facebook to use the FeedBro Service or just go to the privacy & security settings of your computer. In order to clear the browsing data mainly the data refered to as 'cookies'. THen try again with the usage if that doesn't work use the first option. If you're unhappy with the service just uninstall it. No worries. THanks for reading!]
