# Tiffin-Ohio-News-Feed
This is a news feed aggregator. It will be filled with a lot of resources on public places, businesses, events, community news &amp; officials. 

It works by gathering data from public Facebook Pages and organizing them into different categorical newsfeeds. 

So anyone that wants to can stay up to date easily with what goes on locally around town. Making the community more connected. 

The paid method is just 30 dollars a month using BAZQUX RSS which honestly performs slower at getting feeds than Feedbro but looks better.
Feedbro can gather in real time and be used freely by Importing The OPML Feed Subscriptions file into the free Google Chrome extension called FeedBro.

Click on the subscriptions then the file go to Raw now right click and save the file to your computer and import the OPML into Feedbro.
