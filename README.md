# Tiffin-Ohio-News-Feed
A news feed for the town I live in. Filled with a lot of public places, businesses, &amp; officials. 

It works by gathering data from public Facebook Pages and organizing them into different categorical newsfeeds. 

So anyone that wants to can stay up to date easily with what goes on locally around town. Making the community more connected. 

This is to use freely by Importing The OPML Feed Subscriptions file into a free Google Chrome extension called FeedBro.

Click on the subscriptions file on this screen and go to Raw now right click and save the file to your computer and use it on Feedbro.
