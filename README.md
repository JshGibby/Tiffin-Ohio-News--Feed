# Tiffin-Ohio-News-Feed
THis is a news feeds aggregator for the town I live in. Will be filled with a lot of public places, businesses, &amp; officials. 

It works by gathering data from public Facebook Pages and organizing them into different categorical newsfeeds. 

So anyone that wants to can stay up to date easily with what goes on locally around town. Making the community more connected. 

This is to use freely by Importing The OPML Feed Subscriptions file into a free Google Chrome extension called FeedBro.

Click on the subscriptions then the file go to Raw now right click and save the file to your computer and import the OPML into Feedbro.
